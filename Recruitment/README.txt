The present data set was used in the statistical analysis of the paper "Nectar quality affects ant aggressiveness and biotic defense provided to plants" (Biotropica, accepted), authored by FÃ¡bio Pacelhe, Fernanda Costa, Frederico Neves, Judith Bronstein, and Marco Mello.

Metadata:

Plant: Individual plants used in the experiment. Each code refers to Vochysia eliptica (VE) + the individual plant number (i.e., from 01 to 10 for each treatment) + the manipulated resource (i.e., MS = manipulated with sucrose; MSA = manipulated with sucrose and amino acids; MA = with amino acids and MW = manipulated with water).

Treatment: Indicates the type of resource used in each treatment. 

Period: Indicates the period of the day when the observations were made. Daytime encompass sampling from 06:00 to 12:00, and night time from 18:00 to 24:00.

MTE: Minimum Time for Encounter - Time elapsed until the first encounter between an ant and a termite. A proxy for patrolling efficiency of ants on plants.

M.abund.: mean abundance of ants per observation

Obs.T.: Time of observation. We observed ants for 30 min. We stopped the observation after 30 min or when the termite was consumed, left the plant, or fell from the plant due to vibrations caused by wind or ant attacks.

T.exc.: Termite exclusion. Events of termite exclusion by ants during observation (binary variable, 1 = exclusion and 0 = no exclusion).

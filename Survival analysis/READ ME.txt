When using this data archives, please cite both the data archive and the original manuscript 


To use this data set take into account the following information:

Plant: Individual plants used in the experiment. Each code makes reference to the Vochysia eliptica species (VE) + individual plant number (i.e., from 01 to 10 for each treatment) + the manipulated resource (i.e., MS = manipulated with sucrose; MSA = manipulated with sucrose and amino acids; MA = with amino acids and MW = manipulated with water).


Tretment: Indicates the type of resource used in each treatment. 


Period:Indicates period of the day where the observations were undertaken. Daytime encompass samplings from 06 to 12 am, and nighttime from 18 to 24 pm.


Obs.T.: Observation Time. Time of observation. We observed antes for 30 min. We stopped the observation the ants after 30 min or when the termite was consumed, left the plant, or fell from the plant due to vibrations caused by wind or ant attacks.


T.exc.: Termite exclusion. Events of termite exclusion by ants during observation (binary variable, being 1 when there is exclusion and 0 when there is no exclusion).

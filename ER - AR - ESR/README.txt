The present data set was used in the statistical analysis of the paper "Nectar quality affects ant aggressiveness and biotic defense provided to plants" (Biotropica, accepted), authored by FÃ¡bio Pacelhe, Fernanda Costa, Frederico Neves, Judith Bronstein, and Marco Mello.

Metadata:

Plant: Individual plants used in the experiment. Each code refers to Vochysia eliptica (VE) + the individual plant number (i.e., from 01 to 10 for each treatment) + the manipulated resource (i.e., MS = manipulated with sucrose; MSA = manipulated with sucrose and amino acids; MA = with amino acids and MW = manipulated with water).

Treatment: Indicates the type of resource used in each treatment. 

Period: Indicates the period of the day when the observations were made. Daytime encompass sampling from 06:00 to 12:00, and night time from 18:00 to 24:00.

ER: Encounter Rate. Total number of encounters between ants and termites divided by observation time. A proxy for ant recruitment and patrolling on plants, which represents the probability of encounter between ants and termites.

AR: Attack Rate. Total number of ant attacks on termites divided by the total number of encounter during observation. A proxy for ant aggressiveness, and an estimate of the probability of an attack event when the ant encounters the termite.

ESR: Exclusion Success Rate. Events of termite exclusion (binary: 1 = exclusion and 0 = no exclusion) divided by the total number of ant attacks on termites. A proxy for ant aggressiveness, which shows how many ant attacks are needed to exclude the termite from the plant.

EE: Exclusion Efficiency. Events of termite exclusion (binary: 1 = exclusion and 0 = no exclusion) divided by observation time. A proxy for the time spent by the ant to exclude the termite from the plant.

When using this data archives, please cite both the data archive and the original manuscript 


To use this data set take into account the following information:

Plant: Individual plants used in the experiment. Each code makes reference to the Vochysia eliptica species (VE) + individual plant number (i.e., from 01 to 10 for each treatment) + the manipulated resource (i.e., MS = manipulated with sucrose; MSA = manipulated with sucrose and amino acids; MA = with amino acids and MW = manipulated with water).


Tretment: Indicates the type of resource used in each treatment. 


Period:Indicates period of the day where the observations were undertaken. Daytime encompass samplings from 06 to 12 am, and nighttime from 18 to 24 pm.


ER: Encounter Rate. Total number of encounters between ants and termites divided by observation time. A proxy for ant recruitment and patrolling on plants, which represents the probability of encounter between ants and termites.


AR: Attack Rate. Total number of ant attacks to termites divided by the total number of encounter during observation. A proxy for ant aggressiveness, and an estimate of the probability of an attack event when the ant encounters the termite.


ESR: Exclusion Succes Rate. Events of termite exclusion (binary: 1 = exclusion and 0 =no exclusion) divided by the total number of ant attacks to termites. A proxy for ant aggressiveness, which shows how many ant attacks are needed to exclude the termite from the plant.


EE: Exclusion Efficiency. Events of termite exclusion (binary variable, being 1 when there is exclusion and 0 when there is no exclusion) divided by observation time. A proxy for the time spent by the ant to exclude the termite from the plant.
